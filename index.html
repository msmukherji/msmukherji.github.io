<h1> hi, i'm mishka shreya mukherji </h1>

<p><h2> i'm a web developer, a linguist, and a dancer. </h2></p>

<p> i love learning about languages, and a few years ago, i joined a graduate program so i could build an academic career in linguistics.  it turned out that academia wasn't for me-- i enjoyed solving puzzles, but i also wanted to <i>make</i> things that i could see.  having dabbled in various programming languages intermittently throughout school, i was drawn back to it by a computational corpus linguistics class in grad school where we learned a bit of python and played with the natural language toolkit.  i had never thought i could be a programmer, but when i found myself no longer in academia, searching for a new career, i came across the iron yard; i remembered how much i liked my python class, and i decided to give myself a chance to really learn to code.  the iron yard was an incredible experience, and gave me the confidence to say, at the end of three intense months, that i am a developer.  as ever, i'm really excited to keep learning, and i'd love the opportunity to show you what i can do.
<p> below are some of the things i've worked on </p>
<p> links, descriptions</p>
<p> <h3> some other stuff about me </h3> </p>
<p> i'm very involved in the local dance community here in washington, dc.  i really enjoy teaching, but i also perform sometimes.  you can learn about what i do at <a href> www.mayurdance.org </a></p>
<p> here is some stuff i did as a linguist.  i spent many years learning about chomskyan (and non-chomskyan) linguistics - including phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, discourse analysis, sociolinguistic variation, etc - and i still really love thinking about problems in natural languages.  if your company/project is looking for a developer with experience analyzing languages, get in touch with me!</p>
<p> i'm also really interested in literacy.  in the past, i have worked with adult learners trying to get their ged and esl learners trying to improve their pronunciation - efforts i felt really good about - but i've always wanted to contribute to the effort to improve literacy, especially women's literacy, on a global scale; to even the playing field by emphasizing the value of education for everyone.  now that i'm involved in the tech community, i am eager to join the effort to bring technical literacy to traditionally alienated groups.</p>
